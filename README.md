## Data Types in RUST

- Integers can be Signed [i8, i64, ...] and Unsigned [u8, u64, ...]
- Signed integers can be either negative or positive and they range from
``` Caveman
    i8 => n = 8

    -(2^(n-1)) -> 2^(n-1) - 1
```

- Unsigned integers can only be positive 
``` caveman

    u8 => n = 8

    0 -> 2^n - 1
```

- Floats are all Signed (either f32 or f64)

- Booleans are well .. . true or false
